- · ^ For the discount to apply your purchase must be made within 12 months of the eye exam. In addition Full-Feature plans offer 30% off additional prescription glasses and nonprescription sunglasses, including lens options, if purchased on the same day as the eye exam from the same VSP doctor who provided the exam.
- · Charges for an initial purchase can be used toward the material allowance. Any unused balance remaining after the initial purchase cannot be banked for future use. The only exception would be if a member purchases contact lenses from an out of network provider, members can use the balance towards additional contact lenses within the same benefit period.
