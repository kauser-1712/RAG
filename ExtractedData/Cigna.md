Selection of a Primary Care Provider - your plan may require or allow the designation of a primary care provider. You have the right to designate any primary care provider who participates in the network and who is available to accept you or your family members. If your plan requires designation of a primary care provider, Cigna may designate one for you until you make this designation. For information on how to select a primary care provider, and for a list of the participating primary care providers, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card. For children, you may designate a pediatrician as the primary care provider.

Direct Access to Obstetricians and Gynecologists - You do not need prior authorization from the plan or from any other person (including a primary care provider) in order to obtain access to obstetrical or gynecological care from a health care professional in our network who specializes in obstetrics or gynecology. The health care professional, however, may be required to comply with certain procedures, including obtaining prior authorization for certain services, following a pre-approved treatment plan, or procedures for making referrals. For a list of participating health care professionals who specialize in obstetrics or gynecology, visit www.mycigna.com or contact customer service at the phone number listed on the back of your ID card.

## Maximum Reimbursable Charge

The allowable covered expense for non-network services is based on the lesser of the health care professional's normal charge for a similar service or a percentage of a fee schedule (110%) developed by Cigna that is based on a methodology similar to one used by Medicare to determine the allowable fee for the same or similar service in a geographic area. In some cases, the Medicare based fee schedule will not be used and the maximum reimbursable charge for covered services is based on the lesser of the health care professional's normal charge for a similar service or a percentile (80th) of charges made by health care professionals of such service or supply in the geographic area where it is received. If sufficient charge data is unavailable in the database for that geographic area to determine the Maximum Reimbursable Charge, then data in the database for similar services may be used. Out-of-network services are subject to a Calendar Year deductible and maximum reimbursable charge limitations.

## Out-of-Network Emergency Services Charges

- 1. Emergency Services are covered at the In-Network cost-sharing level as required by applicable state or federal law if services are received from a non-participating (Out-of-Network) provider.
- 2. The allowable amount used to determine the Plan's benefit payment for covered Emergency Services rendered in an Out-of-Network Hospital, or by an Out-ofNetwork provider in an In-Network Hospital, is the amount agreed to by the Out-of-Network provider and Cigna, or as required by applicable state or federal law.

## Exclusions

Your plan provides for most medically necessary services. The complete list of exclusions is provided in your Certificate or Summary Plan Description. To the extent there may be differences, the terms of the Certificate or Summary Plan Description control.

In the exercise of that discretion, Cigna shall have the right to require you to provide proof sufficient to Cigna that you have made your required cost share payment(s) prior to the payment of any benefits by Cigna. This exclusion includes, but is not limited to, charges of a non-Participating Provider who has agreed to charge you or charged you at an in-network benefits level or some other benefits level not otherwise applicable to the services received.
