If you do not satisfy the eligibility service requirements during the initial 12-month period beginning on your date of hire, you will still satisfy the eligibility service requirement if you work for a 12-consecutive month period as long as you do not first incur a break in eligibility service. You will be credited with service for any period of time that you are paid or entitled to pay from the Employer beginning on your date of hire. You will also be credited with service for any period of time that you are not employed by the Employer, as long as such period of time is less than 12 months.

If the Plan document is being amended or restated on to a new Plan document and you were eligible to participate in the prior plan, you will continue to be eligible to participate in this Plan without satisfying any additional age or service requirements.

## If I have met the age and service requirements, will I be eligible to participate in the Plan?

Even if you satisfied the age and service requirements, you will not be eligible to participate in the Plan for the contribution types listed below if you are a member of a class of employees that is excluded from participation in the Plan.

## Pre-tax Deferrals

- · You are classified as an independent contractor or non-employee, even if you are incorrectly classified.

## Roth Deferrals

- · You are classified as an independent contractor or non-employee, even if you are incorrectly classified.

## Employer Match

- · You are classified as an independent contractor or non-employee, even if you are incorrectly classified.

## Employer Profit Sharing

- · You are classified as an independent contractor or non-employee, even if you are incorrectly classified.

## Once I am a Plan Participant, what must I do to continue to participate in the Plan?

If your Plan has excluded classes of employees, members of one of these excluded classes will not be able to contribute to the Plan. As a result, you will continue to participate in the Plan as long as you do not become a member of an excluded class. However, your years of vesting service will continue to accumulate as long as you are still employed by the Employer.

## What happens to my Plan eligibility if I terminate my employment and am later rehired?

Once you meet the eligibility requirements and enter the Plan, you will continue to participate while you are still employed by the Employer, even if you have a break in eligibility service. A break in eligibility service occurs if you do not work for a full 12-consecutive month period.

If you had not yet met the eligibility requirements and had a break in eligibility service, the periods before your break in service will not be taken into account and you will have to satisfy the eligibility requirements following your break in service.

Periods during which you have a break in eligibility service will not count against you if you were absent because you were pregnant, adopted or had a child, were serving in the military, or provided certain service during a national emergency (and re-employment is protected under federal or state law), and you start working again for your same Employer within the time required by law.

If you had met the eligibility requirements and were a Participant in the Plan before terminating employment or having a break in eligibility service, and you are later rehired, you will enter the Plan immediately unless your Plan has excluded classes of employees and you fall into one of the categories of excluded employees at the time you are rehired.

## CONTRIBUTIONS

## Can I contribute to the Plan? Elective Deferrals

The Plan allows you to make pre-tax and Roth Deferral contributions. You will be able to contribute a portion of your Compensation as a Deferral once you have met the eligibility requirements and entered the Plan.

The amount of your Compensation that you defer into the Plan will be contributed on a pre-tax basis unless you make a Roth Deferral election by following the procedures established by your Plan Administrator. If you make pre-tax Deferrals, that means that unlike the Compensation that you actually receive, the pre-tax contribution (and all of the earnings accumulated while it is invested in the Plan) will not be taxed at the time it is paid by your Employer. Instead, it will be taxable to you when you take a payment from the Plan. These contributions will reduce your taxable income each year that you make a contribution but will be treated as compensation for Social Security taxes.

EXAMPLE: Your Compensation is $25,000 per year. You decide to contribute 5% of your Compensation into the Plan as a pre-tax Deferral. Your Employer will pay you $23,750 as gross taxable income and will deposit $1,250 (5%) into the Plan. You will not pay income taxes on the $1,250 (plus any earnings on the $1,250) until you withdraw it from the Plan.

If you choose the Roth Deferral option, Roth Deferrals are contributed to the Plan from amounts that have already been treated as taxable income. Roth Deferrals will not reduce your taxable income in the year in which it is paid by your Employer. Instead, the benefit of making Roth contributions comes when you take a payment from the Plan: both the contributions and the earnings on those contributions are paid out tax free as long as you meet certain requirements for a qualified payment.

EXAMPLE: Your Compensation is $25,000 per year. You decide to contribute 5% of your Compensation into the Plan as a Roth Deferral. Your Employer will pay you $23,750 as income and will deposit $1,250 (5%) into the Plan. You will include the entire $25,000 in your income for the year it was earned even though you didn't receive the $1,250 that was contributed to the Plan. When you withdraw the $1,250 contribution from the Plan, it will be tax-free (along with all of the earnings that have accumulated on that contribution) if you take a qualified payment. For more information regarding qualified payments from Roth Deferrals, please refer to the DISTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS section of this SPD.

Deferrals (and the related earnings) are always fully vested and cannot be forfeited. If you were to leave your Employer, you would be entitled to the full Deferral balance (plus earnings) when you are eligible for a payment.

Your Employer allows you to contribute any dollar amount or percentage of your Compensation up to the limits permitted by the law and regulations governing 401(k) plans to the Plan each year as Deferrals.

The maximum dollar amount that you can contribute to the Plan each year is $20,500 (for 2022), and this amount includes contributions you make to other deferral plans (for example, other 401(k) plans, salary deferral SEP plans, 403(b) plans). This amount will increase as the cost-of-living increases. Both pre-tax Deferrals and Roth Deferrals, if applicable, are taken into account when calculating this limit. Your Employer may further limit the amount that you can contribute to the Plan to help the Plan satisfy certain testing requirements. Your Employer will notify you if you are a Highly Compensated Employee and are subject to these special limits.

## Separate Deferral Election for Bonuses

You may not make a separate Deferral election to apply to bonuses that you receive. The Deferral amount or percentage taken from each paycheck will also apply to your bonuses.

## Catch-Up Contributions

You may defer up to an extra $6,500 (for 2022) if you are age 50 or older before the end of the calendar year and once you meet certain Plan limits. The maximum catch-up amount will increase as the cost-of-living increases.

## How do I start making contributions?

To begin deferring a portion of your Compensation into the Plan, you must follow the Deferral election process provided to you by your Plan Administrator.

## If I make a specific election, will the amount of my contributions automatically increase?

No. Your Deferral election will remain the same until you change the amount you are deferring.

## Can I change my contribution rate or stop making Deferrals after I start participating in the Plan?

You may change the amount you are deferring into the Plan-or stop making Deferrals altogether-at the times indicated below by notifying your Plan Administrator of your desire to change your Deferral rate using the method approved by your Plan Administrator (for example, internet or telephone voice response system).

You may also change the amount of your Deferrals that are characterized as pre-tax versus Roth Deferrals as often as listed above for changing the amount of your Deferrals. This change will apply only to new Deferrals and will not change the tax character of Deferrals already contributed to the Plan.

## What if I contribute too much to the Plan?

If you contribute too much to the Plan as a Deferral, you must take the excess amount (plus any earnings on the excess) out of the Plan by April 15 of the year following the year the money was contributed to the Plan. You must notify your Employer, in writing, of the excess amount by March 1.

The excess amount is taxable to you in the year you contributed it to the Plan. If you do not remove it by the deadline, additional taxes will apply.

Unless the Plan provides for safe harbor contributions, the Deferrals that all Highly Compensated Employees contribute to the Plan will be compared with the Deferrals of employees who are not highly compensated. If Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employees exceed certain limits, a portion of Highly Compensated Employee Deferrals may be returned to them. If you are a Highly Compensated Employee, your Plan Administrator will notify you if you are affected by these rules.

## What if I don't make an election to contribute into the Plan?

Your Employer has elected to operate this Plan with an automatic contribution arrangement indicated below.

## Eligible Automatic Contribution Arrangement (EACA)

If you have satisfied the eligibility requirements, but do not make a Deferral election, your Plan Administrator will automatically contribute a portion of your Compensation into the Plan as indicated below. You are not required to defer a portion of your Compensation into the Plan and may instruct your Plan Administrator to stop Deferrals or to defer a different amount by following the procedures established by your Plan Administrator.

Automatic Deferrals will be contributed to the Plan as pre-tax Deferrals.

You will be automatically enrolled if you are a newly eligible employee.

EXAMPLE 1: Your Plan Administrator automatically enrolls Participants at a rate of 4% of their Compensation into the Plan. The automatic enrollment will apply to you if you satisfy the Plan's eligibility requirements and do not enroll in the Plan during the designated time period. You will automatically be enrolled in the Plan and 4% of your Compensation will be contributed to the Plan rather than being paid to you as Compensation.

EXAMPLE 2: Your Plan Administrator automatically enrolls Participants who do not make a Deferral election and defer at a rate of 4% of their Compensation into the Plan. You satisfy the Plan's eligibility requirements and you make a specific election of 0%. Because you made a specific election regarding your Deferrals, you will not be automatically enrolled in the Plan and none of your Compensation will be contributed to the Plan.

## EACA

| If you are automatically enrolled in the Plan, your Plan Administrator will  automatically withhold and contribute to the Plan 5% of your  Compensation.   | Initial Amount of Automatic Elective Deferral   |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Your Plan Administrator will not automatically increase the amount of  your Deferrals.                                                                     | Automatic Deferral Increases                    |

If you terminate employment, and are later rehired, your automatic contribution amount will be reset to the amount described above if no portion of your Deferrals has been automatically contributed to the Plan under the EACA for an entire Plan Year.

EXAMPLE: You were automatically enrolled at 3% of your Compensation in 2017. You terminated your employment late in 2017 and were rehired during the 2019 Plan Year. Because you did not work for the Employer during the 2018 Plan Year, in 2019 you will be treated as a new employee for purposes of the automatic enrollment provision and you will be automatically enrolled at 3% again. This is the case even if the Plan has an automatic increase feature as described above.

EXAMPLE: You were hired in 2017 and affirmatively elected to have 5% withheld from your pay. You terminated your employment late in 2017 and were rehired during the 2019 Plan Year. Because you did not work for the Employer during the 2018 Plan Year, in 2019 you will be treated as a new employee for purposes of the automatic enrollment provision and you will be automatically enrolled at the initial automatic enrollment percentage unless a new affirmative election is made.

You are not required to participate in the Plan and may instruct your Plan Administrator to stop Deferrals or to defer a different percentage by following the procedure established by your Plan Administrator.

## If I make contributions to the Plan, will my Employer match any of those contributions? Matching Contributions

Yes. Each year that you contribute a portion of your Compensation into the Plan and meet any additional conditions outlined below, your Employer may choose to make a contribution to the Plan as a Matching Contribution on your behalf.

Matching Contributions will be made with respect to the following employee contributions.

- · Pre-tax Deferrals
- · Roth Deferrals
- · Catch-up Contributions designated as Pre-tax Deferrals
- · Catch-up Contributions designated as Roth Deferrals

Each year that you make one of the types of contributions listed above and you satisfy any additional requirements for receiving a Matching Contribution, your Employer will make a Matching Contribution to the Plan on your behalf based on the following formula.

## Matching Contribution Formula

Discretionary Match - The amount of the Matching Contribution will be determined by your Employer. Some years, your Employer may choose not to make a Matching Contribution.

The amount of your Matching Contribution will be determined based upon your Compensation and contributions into the Plan during each payroll period.

## Additional Requirements for Receiving Matching Contributions

You must be employed on the last day of the Plan Year.

## Will my Employer make Profit Sharing Contributions to the Plan?

Yes. Each year your Employer may choose to make a contribution to the Plan as a Profit Sharing Contribution on your behalf if you meet any additional conditions outlined below.

You must be employed on the last day of the Plan Year.

The requirement to be employed on the last day of the Plan Year will not apply if any of the following occur.

- · You die.
- · You terminate employment after becoming Disabled.
- · You terminate employment after reaching the Normal Retirement Age.

## Will my Employer make any other types of contributions to the Plan on my behalf? Qualified Nonelective Contributions

Your Employer may decide to make Qualified Nonelective Contributions (QNECs) to the Plan to satisfy special testing rules that apply to the Plan. The amount of the QNEC, if any, will be determined each year by your Employer. These contributions will be allocated to a select group of Participants and will always be fully vested.

## If I have money in other retirement plans, can I combine it with my money in this Plan?

## Rollover Contributions

Yes. You will be allowed to roll over money you have saved in other retirement arrangements into this Plan unless you are part of any excluded class of employees.

Direct Rollovers - Rollover contributions paid directly from the distributing plan to this Plan may be accepted from the following types of plans.

- · Qualified plans

In addition to pre-tax contributions, the following types of contributions will be accepted as direct rollover contributions into the Plan.

- · Nondeductible Employee Contributions
- · Roth Deferrals
- · 403(b) plans

In addition to pre-tax contributions, the following types of contributions will be accepted as direct rollover contributions into the Plan.

- · Nondeductible Employee Contributions
- · Roth Deferrals
- · Governmental 457(b) plans

In addition to pre-tax contributions, the following types of contributions will be accepted as direct rollover contributions into the Plan.

- · Nondeductible Employee Contributions

Indirect Rollovers - Pre-tax rollover contributions distributed to you and then deposited into this Plan as an indirect rollover may be accepted from the following types of plans.

- · Qualified plans
- · 403(b) plans
- · Governmental 457(b) plans

Roth Deferral earnings will be accepted as indirect rollover contributions into the Plan.

Pre-tax portions of Individual Retirement Arrangement (IRA) rollovers will be accepted as rollover contributions into the Plan.

The Plan Administrator will provide you with the forms or information needed to determine whether your prior plan or IRA balance is qualified to be rolled over into this Plan and whether you meet the eligibility requirements for a rollover. You are always 100% vested in your rollover contributions.

## Transfer Contributions

You may be allowed to transfer dollars you have saved in other retirement arrangements into this Plan.

The Plan Administrator will provide you with the forms or information needed to determine whether your prior plan balance is qualified to be transferred into this Plan. You are always 100% vested in your transfer contributions.

## Will I receive a top-heavy minimum contribution in years the Plan is top-heavy?

In any year the Plan is top-heavy, the Employer will make a minimum contribution to this Plan. This contribution will offset any Profit Sharing Contribution you may receive.

If the minimum contribution requirement is not satisfied with other Plan contributions, the remaining contribution that is required will be made to the accounts of Participants who are not Key Employees.

## Are there any limits on how much can be contributed for me?

In addition to the Deferral limit described previously, you may not have total contributions of more than $61,000 (in 2022) or an amount equal to 100% of your Compensation, whichever is less, allocated to the Plan for your benefit each year. This limit will increase as the cost-of-living increases and does not include age 50 catch-up contributions.

## Will contributions be made for me if I am called to military service?

If you are reemployed by your Employer after completing military service, you may be entitled to receive certain make-up contributions from your Employer. If the Plan permits Deferrals or Nondeductible Employee Contributions, you may also have the option of making up missed employee contributions and receiving a Matching Contribution, if applicable, on these contributions.

Contact your Plan Administrator for more information about your options under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994.

## VESTING AND FORFEITURES

## Will I be able to keep my Employer contributions if I terminate employment or am no longer eligible to participate in the Plan?

Like the amounts that you contribute to the Plan as Deferrals, the following types of contributions that you received from your Employer will always be 100% vested and cannot be forfeited, even if you terminate employment or become ineligible to participate in the Plan.

- · QNECs

The following contributions contributed to the Plan by your Employer will be subject to vesting schedules. If the applicable vesting schedule does not provide for immediate 100% vesting, the contributions could be forfeited if you terminate your employment or experience a break in service. However, you will earn the right to a greater portion of these contributions the longer you work for your Employer, as outlined in the schedules below.

- · Matching Contributions
- · Profit Sharing Contributions

EXAMPLE: Your Employer has selected a vesting schedule for:

- ·       Matching Contributions
- ·       Profit Sharing Contributions

The vesting schedule will provide 0% vesting if you have one year of vesting service, 20% vesting if you have two years of vesting service, 40% vesting if you have three years of vesting service, 60% vesting if you have four years of vesting service, 80% vesting if you have five years of vesting service, and 100% vesting if you have six years of vesting service. You have worked for your Employer for four years and have received Employer contributions subject to this vesting schedule of $1,000. You terminate employment and request a distribution of the contributions that your Employer contributed to the Plan on your behalf. Because you have four years of vesting service, you will receive 60% (or $600).

## Matching Contributions

If your Employer makes or has made Matching Contributions to the Plan, including ACP test safe harbor Matching Contributions, or QACA ACP test safe harbor Matching Contributions, the following vesting schedule will apply.

## Vesting Schedule for Matching Contributions

## Profit Sharing Contributions

If your Employer makes or has made Profit Sharing Contributions to the Plan, the following vesting schedule will apply.

## Vesting Schedule for Profit Sharing Contributions

| YEARS OF SERVICE (PERIODS OF SERVICE, IF  APPLICABLE)   | VESTED PERCENTAGE   |
|---------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| Less than 1 Year of Service                             | 0%                  |
| 1 Year of Service                                       | 0%                  |

## Year of Vesting Service

The elapsed time method of determining service applies. No set number of hours will be required to be worked during the vesting service period. You will get service credit for the period of time from your first day of employment through the date you incur a break in service. You will incur a break in service for vesting purposes if you terminate service with your Employer and you do not work for a full 12-month period.

Although your Employer has adopted a vesting schedule, your balance will become 100% vested when you reach Normal Retirement Age, when the Plan is terminated, and when contributions to the Plan are discontinued.

Additionally, your balance will become 100% vested when you

- · die.
- · become Disabled.

## If I become Disabled during military service, will the time that I provided military service be considered for determining the vested portion of my Plan balance?

Not applicable, your Employer's Plan currently provides you with 100% vesting if you become Disabled.

## What happens to my nonvested percentage if I terminate employment?

If you terminate employment, you will always retain the right to the vested portion of your Plan balance. If you do not take a distribution, the nonvested portion of your Plan balance may remain in your account until you have incurred five breaks in vesting service or it may be placed in a suspense account. If the nonvested portion is moved to a suspense account, it will be restored to your account if you are rehired before five breaks in vesting service have occurred. However, if you decide to take a distribution of the entire vested portion of your balance, the nonvested portion of your account will be forfeited. The forfeited amount will be restored to your account if you are rehired before five breaks in vesting service occur and if you repay to the Plan the portion of your distribution that came from contributions that were subject to a vesting schedule.

Forfeitures may be used to pay the Plan's administrative expenses.

## Matching Contributions

Forfeitures of Matching Contributions may also be used to reduce future Employer contributions to the Plan.

## Profit Sharing Contributions

Forfeitures of Profit Sharing Contributions may also be used to reduce future Employer contributions to the Plan.

## How will my vesting credit be affected if I am rehired after termination of employment?

You will receive credit for vesting service that occurred before your break in service.

## DISTRIBUTIONS AND LOANS

The Plan may contain assets that are subject to additional restrictions or requirements (e.g., if you have Plan assets that are transferred from a Money Purchase Pension plan) or are not specifically addressed in this section (e.g., if you have Plan assets that are Nondeductible Employee Contributions). Please contact your Plan Administrator for information regarding these assets.

The distribution options specific to Deferrals below will also apply to the following types of contributions.

- · QNECs

## Will I ever be required to take my money out of the Plan?

When you are required to take your money out of the Plan varies depending on your Plan balance, your age, and whether you are still employed.

## Cashouts at Termination of Employment

The Plan has a cashout level of $5,000.

This means that if your vested balance at the time you terminate from employment is less than or equal to the cashout level, you must take it out of the Plan when you terminate employment. Your Plan Administrator may pay this amount to you in cash or roll it over to an IRA on your behalf, if you do not direct your Employer otherwise.

If your balance is between $1,000 and $5,000, you must take your vested balance from the Plan or your Plan Administrator will roll it over to an IRA that is established for you. The amount distributed and rolled over into an IRA by the Plan Administrator (and not authorized by you) will be invested in a product designed to preserve principal and to provide a reasonable rate of return and liquidity. The IRA provider that receives the rollover may charge fees and expenses for maintaining the IRA, and these fees and expenses may be assessed directly against the assets of the IRA or billed directly to you. You will be provided more information regarding the IRA provider if you become subject to this provision. For more information concerning the rollover procedures, the IRA provider, and the associated fees and expenses, please contact your Plan Administrator, whose address and telephone number are found in the ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION AND RIGHTS UNDER ERISA section of this SPD.

If your balance is greater than $5,000, even if you terminate service, you are not required to take a payment from the Plan until the required distribution rules apply to you. However, if your Employer chooses, your balance may be immediately distributed to you if you have separated from service and reached the later of age 62 or the Plan's Normal Retirement Age.

Rollover contributions will be included in determining your balance for these cashout purposes. If you have both pre-tax Deferrals and Roth Deferrals in the Plan, special calculation rules for determining the amount to be rolled over may apply.

## Required Minimum Distributions

You will be required to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) upon your Required Beginning Date. These distributions will generally be required to start when you attain age 70½. The Plan's Required Beginning Date is found in the DEFINITIONS section of this SPD.

## Will Employer contributions be available to me if I terminate employment before I reach Normal Retirement Age?

Yes, if you terminate employment before you reach Normal Retirement Age, you may access the vested portion of your balance from the following Employer contributions.

- · Matching Contributions
- · Profit Sharing Contributions

## Are my Deferrals available to me once I terminate employment?

If you terminate employment, you may access your Deferrals.

## Can I withdraw money from the Plan while I am still employed?

The Plan is designed to help you build an account that will help support you during your retirement years. However, you may be able to take certain distributions from the Plan while you are still working for your Employer, as indicated below.

## In-Service Distributions

You may request a distribution while you are still employed from the following Plan accounts.

- · Rollover contributions at any time
- · Deferrals, but only after you reach age 59.5
- · Deferrals, but only after you reach Normal Retirement Age

Deferrals that may be distributed after reaching the age(s) specified above will include

- · Pre-tax Deferrals
- · Roth Deferrals
- · Deferrals, but only if you were called to active military duty after September 11, 2001, for a period of at least 180 days or an indefinite period, and your distributions are taken after you were called to duty and before your active duty ended
- · Deferrals, but only if you incur a deemed severance because you are on active duty in the uniformed services for a period of more than 30 days without severing from employment with your Employer. However, if you choose to take distributions under this provision, you will not be permitted to make Deferrals or Nondeductible Employee Contributions to the Plan during the six-month period beginning on the date of the distribution

You may request a distribution from the following contributions if you become Disabled.

- · Deferrals
- · Matching Contributions
- · Profit Sharing Contributions

You may request a distribution from your Matching Contributions account if the following conditions are satisfied.

- · You reach age 59½.
- · You reach Normal Retirement Age.

You may take an unlimited number of distributions from Matching Contributions while you are still employed.

You may request a distribution from your Profit Sharing Contributions account if the following conditions are satisfied.

- · You reach age 59½.
- · You reach Normal Retirement Age.

You may take an unlimited number of distributions from Profit Sharing Contributions while you are still employed.

## Hardship Distributions of Deferrals

You may request a distribution from the following contributions if you have a financial hardship.

- · Pre-tax Deferrals, including any earnings
- · Roth Deferrals, including any earnings

## Hardship Distributions of Employer Contributions

If you have a financial hardship, you may take a distribution from the following contribution types.

- · Matching Contributions
- · Profit Sharing Contributions

## Hardship Distributions of QNECs, QMACs, and Safe Harbor Contributions

If you have a financial hardship, you may take a distribution from Qualified Nonelective Contributions, Qualified Matching Contributions, ADP safe harbor contributions, or QACA ADP safe harbor employer contributions, if applicable, including any earnings on the respective contributions.

The types of expenses that qualify for a hardship distribution include medical expenses for you, your spouse, or your dependents; payment to purchase your principal residence; tuition and education-related expenses for you, your spouse, or your dependents; payments to prevent eviction from your principal residence; funeral expenses for your parent, your spouse, or your dependents; payments to repair your principal residence that qualify for a casualty loss deduction; and expenses and losses (including loss of income) that you incurred as a result of a disaster declared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency because your principal residence or principal place of employment was located in the area at the time of the disaster.

Before you take a hardship distribution, you must take all other distributions, excluding nontaxable loans, available to you under the Plan.

If you take a hardship distribution of Deferrals, you will not be eligible to make Deferrals (and Nondeductible Employee Contributions, if applicable) for the next six months.

However, the six-month restriction will not continue during the Plan Year beginning on or after January 1, 2019. If you take a hardship distribution on or after January 1, 2020, you will be eligible to make Deferrals (and Nondeductible Employee Contributions, if applicable) immediately following the hardship distribution.

If you are under age 59½, the taxable portion of the amount you take out of the Plan as a hardship distribution will generally be subject to a 10% penalty tax. There are some exceptions to the 10% penalty. Your tax advisor can assist you in determining whether you qualify for a penalty exception.

## Will I be permitted to withdraw Deferrals that are automatically contributed to the Plan on my behalf? Withdrawals Under an EACA

Yes, you will be permitted to withdraw (without penalty) that portion of your Deferrals that has been automatically contributed to the Plan under the EACA.

Your election to withdraw must be made within 90 days following the payroll date that your first Deferral was deducted from your paycheck and automatically contributed to the Plan.

If you choose to withdraw your Deferrals, your withdrawal will also consist of any earnings attributable to those Deferrals. Any Matching Contributions made by your Employer that are related to those Deferrals will be forfeited.

You will be treated as if you have not participated in the EACA before if no portion of your Deferrals has been automatically contributed to the Plan under the EACA for an entire Plan Year. This will affect whether you will be permitted to withdraw that portion of your Deferrals that has been automatically contributed to the Plan under the EACA after you are rehired or your Deferral election expires and you are reenrolled in the EACA.

## How will my money be distributed to me if my balance is less than the cashout level or if I request a payment from the Plan?

If you do not tell your Plan Administrator what to do with your account under the Plan (for example, roll it over to an IRA), and your balance of $1,000 or less is being cashed-out of the Plan, your Plan Administrator will distribute your Plan account as a lump sum.

If you request a payment, you may choose from the following options for your payment.

- · Lump sum
- · Non-recurring partial payments

If your distribution is eligible to be rolled over, you may choose to have your distribution paid to another eligible retirement arrangement. Contact the Plan Administrator for the documentation and procedures that apply to rollovers.

## How do I request a payment?

You (or your beneficiary) must follow the procedures defined by the Plan Administrator for processing distributions.

If you are taking a hardship distribution, you must provide documents to verify that you have a hardship event that qualifies for a Plan distribution.

If you die, become Disabled, or reach Normal Retirement Age and you qualify for and request a distribution, your distribution will begin as soon as administratively feasible after the date you (or your beneficiary, in the case of your death) request a distribution.

If you terminate your employment and you qualify for and request a distribution, your distribution will begin as soon as administratively feasible after the date you request a distribution.

## What if I die before receiving all of my money from the Plan?

If you die before taking all of your assets from the Plan, the remaining balance will be paid to your designated beneficiary. If you do not name a beneficiary and you are married, your spouse will be your beneficiary. If you do not name a beneficiary and you are not married, your remaining balance in the Plan will be paid to your estate.

To designate your beneficiary, you must follow the procedures established by the Plan Administrator. If you are married and decide to name someone other than your spouse as your beneficiary, your spouse must consent in writing to your designation. It is important to review your designation from time to time and update it if your circumstances change (for example, a divorce or death of a named beneficiary).

Your beneficiary will generally have the same options regarding the form of the distribution that are available to you as a Participant. If the Plan is subject to the spousal consent requirements, however, and the balance is greater than $5,000, your beneficiary may be required to take the payments in the form of a life annuity, unless the annuity has been properly waived by you (and your spouse, if applicable) during your lifetime. Your spouse beneficiary may also have the option of rolling over a distribution into an IRA in his or her own name.

If you die before your Required Beginning Date, your beneficiary may have the option of (1) taking annual payments beginning the year following your death (or the year you would have reached age 70½, if your spouse is your beneficiary), or (2) depleting the entire balance of the account by the end of the year in which the fifth anniversary of your death occurs. Beneficiaries that choose this option do not have to take annual payments, provided they take the entire amount by the end of that fifth year. If you die after your Required Beginning Date, your beneficiary must continue taking distributions from the Plan at least annually.

The Plan permits beneficiaries to directly roll over their portion of the individual account to an inherited IRA. Such distribution must otherwise qualify as a distribution that is eligible to roll over.

## If I am married, does my spouse have to approve my distributions from the Plan? Spousal Consent Rules Do NOT Apply to the Plan (the Retirement Equity Act safe harbor applies)

You are not required to get consent from your spouse in order to take a payment or loan from the Plan. However, your spouse must be your beneficiary under the Plan unless your spouse provides written consent to designate a different beneficiary.

## Do any penalties or restrictions apply to my payments?

Generally, if you take a payment from the Plan before you are age 59½, a 10% early distribution penalty will apply to the taxable portion of your payment. There are some exceptions to the 10% penalty. Your tax advisor can assist you in determining whether you qualify for a penalty exception.

If your payment is eligible to be rolled over and you take the payment rather than rolling it over to another retirement arrangement, 20% of the taxable portion of your payment will be withheld and sent to the IRS as a credit toward the taxes you will owe on the payment amount.

EXAMPLE: You request a $10,000 payment from your Plan balance. If the amount is eligible to be rolled over to another plan, but you choose not to roll it over, you will receive $8,000 and $2,000 will be sent to the IRS.

If you have made Roth Deferrals into the Plan, each distribution will consist of a portion of your Roth Deferrals and a portion of the earnings attributable to the Roth Deferrals (which have not been taxed). The earnings will be included in income and generally subject to the 10% early distribution penalty unless you are eligible to take a qualified Roth distribution. You may take a qualified Roth distribution only if at least five years have passed since you first began making Roth Deferrals in this Plan and you take the distribution because you reach age 59½, you become Disabled, or you die and the payment is being made to your beneficiary.

## What if the Plan is terminated?

If the Plan is terminated, you will be required to take your entire account balance from the Plan.

## Can I take a loan from the Plan?

Yes. Although the Plan is designed primarily to help you save for retirement, you may take a loan from the Plan for any purpose.

You will be permitted to have only 1 loan(s) outstanding at any time.

The maximum loan amount available to you will be

- · $50,000 or one-half of your vested balance in the Plan, whichever is less.

No loans will be issued for less than $1,000.00. A portion of your Plan balance will be pledged as security for your loan.

If this Plan contains Roth Deferrals, it does not allow you to take loans from Roth Deferrals and earnings.

These loan provisions are effective 09/01/2022.

## How do I apply for a loan?

To apply for a loan, you must complete and submit the loan application provided (or approved) by the Plan Administrator and pay any applicable loan fees. Your loan administrator is Privis Health, Inc.

You can contact your loan administrator at:

Business Address:

4819 Emperor Blvd, Ste 400

Durham, NC 27560

Business Telephone: (888) 533-9490

The loan administrator will administer the loan program and will consider the following when reviewing your loan request.

- · The vested portion of your account balance

The interest rate for your loan will be computed using the prime rate (as specified in the Wall Street Journal) plus 1%.

## What happens if I don't repay my loan?

You will be required to repay the loan amount (plus interest) to the Plan. If you default on the loan, you will be taxed on the taxable portion of the outstanding loan balance and will be subject to a 10% penalty if you are under age 59½. The following events will cause a loan default.

- · Failure to remit payment in a timely manner as required under the loan agreement
- · Breach of any of your obligations or duties under the loan agreement
- · Terminating employment

If you default on your loan for failing to make your scheduled loan payments, you will not be taxed on the taxable portion of the outstanding loan balance (plus interest) if you make up the missed payments by the end of the calendar quarter following the calendar quarter in which the default occurred.

If you have a loan outstanding when you terminate employment and terminating employment is a loan default event, you will not be taxed on the taxable portion of the outstanding loan balance (plus interest) if you repay the loan by the earlier of a) the date designated by the plan sponsor, or b) 60 days after separation from service.

The Employer makes the contribution to a trust fund where all dollars are held for the benefit of the Participants. This Plan is a 401(k) profit sharing defined contribution plan, which means that contributions to the Plan made on your behalf (and earnings) will be separately accounted for within the Plan.

## Who is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Plan?

Your Plan Administrator (the Employer) is responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Plan. To assist in operating the Plan efficiently and accurately, your Plan Administrator may appoint others to act on its behalf or to perform certain functions.

## Who pays the expenses for operating the Plan?

All reasonable Plan administration expenses, including those involved in retaining necessary professional assistance, may be paid from the assets of the Plan. These expenses may be allocated among you and all other Plan Participants or, for expenses directly related to you, charged against your account balance. Examples of expenses that may be directly related to you include fees for processing your distributions or loans (if applicable), processing qualified domestic relations orders, and processing your Plan investment direction, if applicable. Finally, the Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, pay any or all of these expenses. For example, the Plan Administrator may pay expenses for current employees, but may deduct the expenses of former employees directly from their accounts. The Plan Administrator will provide you with a summary of all Plan expenses and the method of payment of the expenses periodically, as required and upon request.

## Does my Employer have the right to change the Plan?

The Plan will be amended from time to time to incorporate changes required by the law and regulations governing retirement plans. Your Employer also has the right to amend the Plan to add new features, to change or eliminate various provisions, or to terminate the plan. An employer cannot amend the Plan to take away or reduce protected benefits under the Plan (for example, the Employer cannot reduce the vesting percentage that applies to your current balance in the Plan).

## Does participation in the Plan provide any legal rights regarding my employment?

The Plan does not intend to provide and does not provide any additional rights to employment or constitute a contract for your employment. The purpose of the SPD is to help you understand how the Plan operates and the benefits available to you under the Plan. The Plan document is the legal document that controls the operation of (and rights granted under) the Plan. If there are any inconsistencies between this SPD and the Plan document, the Plan document will be followed.

## Can creditors or other individuals request a payment from my Plan balance?

Creditors (other than the IRS) and others generally may not request a distribution from your Plan balance. One major exception to this rule is that your Plan Administrator may distribute or reallocate your benefits in response to a qualified domestic relations order. A qualified domestic relations order is an order or decree issued by a court that requires you to pay child support or alimony or to give a portion of your Plan account to an ex-spouse or legally separated spouse. The Plan Administrator will review the order to ensure that it meets certain criteria before any money is paid from your account. You (or your beneficiary) may obtain, at no charge, a copy of the procedures the Plan Administrator will use for reviewing and qualifying domestic relations orders.

## How do I file a claim?

To claim a benefit that you are entitled to under the Plan, you must file a written request with the Plan Administrator. The claim must set forth the reasons you believe you are eligible to receive benefits and you must authorize the Plan Administrator to conduct any necessary examinations and take the steps to evaluate your claim.

## What if my claim is denied, in whole or in part? Non-Disability Determination

Except as described below, if your claim is denied (in whole or in part), your Plan Administrator will provide you (or your beneficiary) with notice, in writing or in any allowable format, of the Adverse Determination within a reasonable amount of time, but not later than 90 days after the date your claim was filed. The 90-day time period may be extended for up to 90 days if your Plan Administrator determines that an extension is necessary to process your claim due to special circumstances. Your Plan Administrator will notify you, in writing or in any other allowable format, before the end of the initial 90-day period, of the reason(s) for the extension and the date by which a decision is expected to be made regarding your claim.

The period of time within which approval or denial of your claim is required to be made generally begins at the time your claim is filed.

Agent Address: 4819 Emperor Blvd, Ste 400

Agent Address: 4819 Emperor Blvd, Ste 400

Agent City: Durham    State: NC    Zip: 27560

The Plan Administrator and the Plan trustee(s) can also be served with required legal documents.

## If the Plan terminates, does the federal government insure my benefits under the Plan?

If the Plan terminates, you will become fully vested in your entire balance under the Plan, even though you would not otherwise have a sufficient number of years of vesting service to be 100% vested in your balance. You will be entitled to take your entire balance from the Plan following plan termination.

The type of plan in which you participate is not insured by the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, which is the government agency that insures certain pension plan benefits upon plan termination.

## What are my legal rights and protections under the Plan?

As a Participant in this Plan, you are entitled to certain rights and protections under ERISA. ERISA provides that all Plan Participants shall be entitled to the following.

## Receive Information About Your Plan and Benefits

- 1. Examine, without charge, at the Plan Administrator's office and at other specified locations, such as worksites and union halls, all Plan documents governing the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and a copy of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) filed by the Plan with the U.S. Department of Labor and available at the Public Disclosure Room of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.
- 2. Obtain, upon request to the Plan Administrator, copies of documents governing the operations of the Plan, including insurance contracts and collective bargaining agreements, and copies of the latest annual report (Form 5500 Series) and updated SPD. The Plan Administrator may charge a reasonable fee for the copies.
- 3. Receive a summary of the Plan's annual financial report. The Plan Administrator is required by law to furnish each Participant with a copy of this Summary Annual Report.
- 4. Obtain, once per year, a statement of the total pension benefits accrued and the vested pension benefits (if any) or the earliest date upon which benefits will become vested. The Plan may require a written request for this statement, but it must provide the statement free of charge.

## Prudent Actions by Plan Fiduciaries

In addition to creating rights for Plan Participants, ERISA imposes duties upon the people who are responsible for the operation of the Plan. The people who operate your Plan, called 'fiduciaries' of the Plan, have a duty to do so prudently and in the interest of you and other Plan Participants and beneficiaries. No one, including your Employer, your union, or any other person, may fire you or otherwise discriminate against you in any way to prevent you from obtaining a pension benefit or exercising your rights under ERISA.

## Enforce Your Rights

If your claim for a benefit is denied or ignored, in whole or in part, you have a right to know why this was done, to obtain copies of documents relating to the decision without charge, and to appeal any denial, all within certain time schedules. Under ERISA, there are steps you may take to enforce the above rights. For instance, if you request a copy of Plan documents or the latest annual report from the Plan and do not receive them within 30 days, you may file suit in a federal court. In such a case, the court may require the Plan Administrator to provide the materials and pay you up to $110 a day until you receive the materials, unless the materials were not sent because of reasons beyond the control of the Plan Administrator. If you have a claim for benefits which is denied, or ignored, in whole or in part, you may file suit in a state or federal court. In addition, if you disagree with the Plan's decision, or lack thereof, concerning the qualified status of a domestic relations order or a medical child support order, you may file suit in federal court. If it should happen that Plan fiduciaries misuse the Plan's money, or if you are discriminated against for asserting your rights, you may seek assistance from the U.S. Department of Labor, or you may file suit in a federal court. The court will decide who should pay court costs and legal fees. If you are successful, the court may order the person you have sued to pay the costs and fees. If you lose, the court may order you to pay these costs and fees, for example, if the court finds your claim is frivolous.

## Assistance With Your Questions

If you have any questions about your Plan, you should contact the Plan Administrator. If you have any questions about this statement or about your rights under ERISA, or if you need assistance in obtaining documents from the Plan Administrator, you should contact the nearest area office of the Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, listed in your telephone directory or the Division of Technical Assistance and Inquiries, Employee Benefits Security Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue N.W., Washington D.C. 20210. You may also obtain certain publications about your rights and responsibilities under ERISA by calling the publications hotline of the Employee Benefits Security Administration.

Further, if this Plan is maintained by more than one employer, you may obtain a complete list of all such employers by making a written request to the Plan Administrator.

## INVESTMENTS

## What investments are permitted under the Plan?

Your Plan Administrator (or someone appointed by your Plan Administrator) will select a list of investments that will be available under the Plan. The list of Plan investments may change from time to time as the Plan Administrator considers appropriate investment alternatives.

Life insurance investments will not be available under the Plan.

Qualifying longevity annuity contracts (QLAC) will not be available under the Plan.

## Am I responsible for selecting the investments for my account under the Plan?

Yes, you have the right to decide how some or all of your Plan account will be invested. The Plan Administrator will establish administrative procedures that you must follow to select your investments. If you do not select investments for your Plan account, the Plan Administrator will determine how your account will be invested. The Plan Administrator will provide you with information regarding the range of permissible investments. You should carefully review the investment prospectus or other available information before making your investment selections. Contact the Plan Administrator if you are not certain whether a particular investment is permitted under the Plan. If you do not select investments for your Plan account, the Plan Administrator will determine how your account will be invested.

The Plan Administrator will permit you to select the investments for the entire account.

The Plan Administrator intends to operate this Plan in compliance with the requirements pertaining to Participant direction of investments in Section 404(c) of ERISA, and Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 2550.404c-1. This means that the Plan Administrator and others in charge of the Plan will not be responsible for any losses that result from investment instructions given by you or your beneficiary.

## How frequently can I change my investment elections?

You may change your investment selections at times designated by the Plan Administrator.

## What are my investment options if my account contains publicly traded Employer stock?

For Plan Years beginning on or after January 1, 2007, if applicable, you were able to change your investments in Employer stock held within your account. This rule allows you to invest your account in a broader range of investments that are offered by your Plan Administrator, which may help you to increase your earnings and/ or lessen your risk. If the Plan previously placed restrictions on selling the Employer stock held in your account, please review the 'Notice of Right to Diversify Employer Securities' you previously received or ask the Plan Administrator for a copy if you need an additional copy. If you have additional questions, please ask the Plan Administrator for more information.

## Highly Compensated Employee - A Highly Compensated Employee is any employee who

- 1. was more than a 5% owner at any time during the year or the previous year, or
- 2. for the previous year had compensation from the Employer greater than $135,000 (for 2022). This amount will increase as the cost-of-living increases.

Additional provisions selected by the Employer may impact the definition of a Highly Compensated Employee. Contact your Plan Administrator for additional details.

For purposes of determining Plan eligibility, an Hour of Service will be based on the elapsed time method. You will get service credit for the period of time from your first day of employment through the date you incur a break in service.

Profit Sharing Contribution - A Profit Sharing Contribution is a contribution your Employer may choose to make each year based on the formula in the Plan document for Participants who meet the Profit Sharing Contribution eligibility requirements. Your eligibility to receive Profit Sharing Contributions does not depend on whether you make Deferrals.

Qualified Nonelective Contribution - A Qualified Nonelective Contribution (QNEC) is a contribution your Employer may make into the Plan to satisfy certain nondiscrimination tests that apply to the Plan. Your Employer may also make a QNEC based on the formula in the Plan document each year for those who meet the eligibility requirements for a QNEC. Your eligibility to receive a QNEC does not depend on whether you make Deferrals. A QNEC contribution is 100 percent vested when made.

Required Beginning Date - When you reach age 70½ you will generally need to begin taking a portion of your balance out of the Plan each year. This distribution is called a required minimum distribution, or RMD. If you continue to work for your Employer after age 70½, you may delay your required distributions until you actually stop working for your Employer unless you own more than 5% of the Employer. If you own more than 5% of the Employer, you will need to begin taking payments at age 70½ even if you are still employed. The annual required distribution amount is generally based on your account balance divided by a life expectancy factor outlined in retirement plan regulations.

Tax Year End - Your Employer's Tax Year End is 12/31.
